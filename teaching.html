      <h2>S371-Statistics for Sociology</h2>
<p> Statistics are frequently used by the media and politicians to make claims and predictions. Most of us have heard such things as "women earn less than men" or "Obama is likely to win the next presidential election". In this class, we will learn techniques to understand, assess and produce similar statistics. We will first focus on describing a sample of people and then use this information to generalize about a larger population. Topics will include measures of central tendency and spread, basic probability, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing and ordinary least squares regression. Students taking this class will learn to analyze data using a statistical analysis software (SPSS) and present findings in a clear and compelling way. These skills are very marketable and used in many industries. To take this course, you do not need to have any previous experience with statistics. </p>

<h2>Immigration to Western Europe and the US</h2>
<p>Recent attacks in France and Belgium by descendants of immigrants and the rise of far right political groups have brought to light issues in immigrant incorporation in Western Europe. These issues, however, are not new and nation states have long tried to create policies that affect migration and incorporation. In the U.S., recent immigration of children from South America displayed both the harsh conditions of life in the children’s home countries but also the animosity towards integration in U.S. towns. The lack of public support and the grim educational and economic outcomes of children of immigrants call into question classic theories of assimilation developed in the U.S. and provide new grounds to develop research on immigration. </p>

<p>This class will provide students with a theoretical background to understand the current issues surrounding immigration across countries. During the class, we will first discuss major theories on migration and immigrant incorporation. Then, we will apply these theories to the European and North American context and evaluate their claims using recent empirical data. To that end, we will compare policies of different countries and investigate the role of nation-states in controlling borders and reinforcing a system of stratification. We will discuss native’s attitudes towards immigrants and boundaries within countries created around racial, ethnic and religious differences. Finally, we will analyze the outcomes of second generation immigrants’ incorporation. </p>

<h2>Categorical Data Analysis (Teaching Assistant for <a href="http://shawnasmith.net/">Shawna Smith </a>at <a href="https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/sumprog/index.jsp">ICPSR</a>)</h2>

<p> The course begins by considering the general objectives for interpreting the results of any regression model and then considers why these objectives are more complicated within nonlinear models. Basic concepts and notation are introduced through a short review of the linear regression model, as well as a brief overview of the method of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). From there, we will ‘derive’ the binary logit and probit models for use with binary outcomes, and also introduce a variety of post-estimation tools for interpreting nonlinear models. Testing and fit for non-linear models will also be considered. We will then extend the binary logit and probit models and methods of interpretation to ordinal outcomes using the ordered logit and probit models, and nominal outcomes with the multinomial logit. Finally, the course will conclude by introducing a series of models for count data, including Poisson regression, negative binomial regression, and zero-modified variant models. </p>

<h2>S110-Charts, Graphs and Tables</h2>
<p>The goal of this course is to teach you to become critical consumers of social statistics and their presentation in our daily lives. You will become familiar with the central concepts and techniques that sociologists use to understand the social world, as well as the fundamental concepts of sociology. Examples from various subfields within sociology are used to illustrate each concept. When you successfully complete this course, you will have:
    <ul>
      <li>The ability to read and understand social statistics</li>
      <li>The ability to produce and present data in meaningful ways</li>
      <li>The ability to apply the sociological perspective to social problems</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>S101 - Contemporary Global Social Problems</h2>
<p>This course examines similarities and differences in social problems experienced around the world. We will consider topics around globalization, challenges in migration, gender inequality, ethnic and racial variation, religious extremism, and health. Through articles, books, films and music, students will gain an understanding of current global issues and how these vary across cultural contexts. We will explore and compare how different countries approach and seek solutions to these social problems, and how sociologists today research global social problems.By the end of the course, students should be able to:
<ul>
	<li>Understand globalization and its consequences on inequality</li>
	<li>Compare and contrast issues across cultural contexts</li>
	<li>Apply the sociological perspective to social problems</li>
	<li>Examine and analyze current global social problems</li>
</ul>
