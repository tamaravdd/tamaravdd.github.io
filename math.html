      <h1> Testing Mathematical Models of Social Processes </h1>
      <p> <strong>van der Does, Tamara and Muna Adem. "Gendered Paths in Identity Development for Children of Immigrants" <i> Published in <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/eprint/pcjFGegenZW3Sqv3t8hb/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emerging Adulthood </a> </i> </strong> </p>
        
      <p> This study uses the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Study 1991-2006 to examine if young men and women children of immigrants follow different paths in identity formation between early adolescence and young adulthood. Using multinomial logistic regression on multiply imputed data, we find that for both women and men, the number of children of immigrants who identify as American decreases over time while the number who identify as racial or pan-ethnic increases. In contrast to prior studies, we find that between the ages of 14 and 24, men are more likely than women to change identities and to move away from an American identity. Women, on the other hand, tend to keep a racial or pan-ethnic identity from adolescence to adulthood. The results for within-group differences suggest that men with immigrant parents tend to reject their American identity in favor of a racial or pan-ethnic identity, a sign of adversarial outlook and marginalization. This study highlights identification patterns over time for children of immigrants, and the importance of understanding social processes separately for women and men. The implications of these results, especially the effects of discrimination, socio-economic status, and length of residence in the U.S. for identity formation, are discussed. </p>

      <p> <strong> Kucinskas, Jaime and Tamara van der Does. 2017. <a href="files\Muslim Mens Gender Ideology During Turbulent Times_KucinskasvanderDoes.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> "Gender Ideals in Turbulent Times: An Examination of Insecurity, Islam, and Muslim Men’s Gender Attitudes during the Arab Spring." </a> <i> Published in <a href="http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/15691330-12341428" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Comparative Sociology  </a> </i> </strong> </p>
        
    <p>Using Arab Barometer data (2011), we examine Muslim men’s gender attitudes in four predominantly Muslim Middle Eastern and North African countries (Algeria, Egypt, Tunisia, and Yemen) during the Arab Spring. We examine if living in insecurity – which may threaten men’s ability to attain masculine ideals – is related to male overcompensation, evident in strong support for patriarchal gender ideology. They then investigate if Islamic religiosity influences this relationship. Results reveal that political Islam is strongly related to Muslim MENA men’s patriarchal gender attitudes across the region. The effects of living in insecurity and other facets of Islamic religiosity on men’s gender ideology vary by country. The results on the many effects of insecurity and Islam on men’s gender ideology challenge stereotypical representations of the region as uniformly Islamic and patriarchal. </p>
