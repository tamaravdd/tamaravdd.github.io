<p> My dissertation investigates the emergence of a shared group identity in adolescence for Muslim descendants of immigrants in Europe, and it considers how this shared group identity, can, in turn, be used for political engagement and incorporation in adulthood. I posit Muslim identity in Europe as a racialized pan-ethnic identity: an imposed categorization which unifies individuals from diverse backgrounds. </p>
<p> Specifically, I investigate how the context of reception (national incorporation policies and regional attitudes from the native majority) shapes three facets of Muslim pan-ethnic identity: 1) its development in adolescence independently from national origins and personal religiosity, 2) its roots in shared experiences of religious discrimination, and 3) its potential for political engagement in adulthood through pan-ethnic organizations. In order to study pan-ethnic identity across these three domains, I use latent growth curve analysis for modeling Muslim adolescents’ identity salience between ninth and eleventh grade in Germany, the Netherlands, England and Sweden, and multilevel modeling for analyzing Muslims’ religious and political incorporation in nineteen European countries. My dissertation uses the recently available Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Study in four European Countries, the European Social Survey of nineteen European countries, and data on country-level immigration policy. </p>
