        <p> I am a program postdoctoral fellow at the <a href="https://www.santafe.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Santa Fe Institute </a> working with professor <a href="https://www.santafe.edu/people/profile/mirta-galesic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mirta Galesic </a> on her USDA-NIFA funded project on modeling belief change using techniques inspired by statistical phycis. I hold a <a> href="https://www.indiana.edu/~soc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PhD in Sociology from Indiana University</a>, where I also completed an <a> href="https://stat.indiana.edu/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"M.S. in Applied Statistics</a>. </p>
         <p> I am interested in how social identities and beliefs develop and change within larger social environments. My dissertation focused on the emergence of a <a href="dissertation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pan-ethnic Muslim identity</a> among children of immigrants in Europe, and its potential for political engagement in adulthood. In collaboration with Muna Adem, I work on several projects which tackle the development and consequences of <a href="ethnid.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">racial and ethnic identities</a> for children of immigrants in the U.S. and in Europe. At the Santa Fe Institute, I am working on <a href="math.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">testing mathematical models</a> to predict changes in beliefs and identity signaling. In collaboration with Mirta Galesic, Dan Stein and Nina Fedoroff, I analyze how personal moral values and social networks shape the formation of scientific beliefs. In another project with Mirta Galesic and Paul Smaldino, I focus on how the social context shapes the type of identity siganling online. </p>
    <p> In my <a href="teaching.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teaching</a>, I focus on broadening students' cross-cultural perspective, demystifying statistics, and connecting the process of social science research with students' own experiences and interests. For three years, I was an Associate Instructor at Indiana University and taught intro- and upper-level courses focusing on statistics and immigration studies. I was also a teaching assistant for two summpers at <a href="https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/sumprog/index.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ICPSR summer program in quantitative methods of social research</a>. the At the Santa Fe Institute, I continue to mentor undergraduates during their summer research experience.  </p>
