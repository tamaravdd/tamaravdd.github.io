      <p> <strong> McManus, Patricia, Tamara van der Does and Muna Adem. "Parental Transmission of Gender Ideology in Adolescence: Evidence from Immigrants and Natives in Europe". <i>Manuscript in Progress</i> </strong> </p>

      <p> In this project, we assess gender traditionalism and the intergenerational transmission of gender attitudes among adolescents using data on immigrant and native mother-daughter dyads from the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Survey in Four European Countries (CILS4EU). Our results show a strong association between mother’s gender attitudes and daughter’s gender attitudes among both immigrants and natives, with no significant differences between the two groups. We also find that immigrant-native differences in traditionalism are smaller among daughters than among mothers, evidence of convergence and acculturation in the second generation. However, the persistence of family cultural origins and the greater prevalence of both Christian and Muslim religiosity among immigrant parents result in significantly higher levels of traditionalism among adolescent children of immigrants as compa red to their native peers. </p>

      <p> <strong>van der Does, Tamara and Muna Adem. "Gendered Paths in Identity Development for Children of Immigrants" <i> Manuscript in Progress</i> </strong> </p>
      <p> This study uses the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Study 1991-2006 to examine if young men and women children of immigrants follow different paths in identity formation between early adolescence and young adulthood. Using multinomial logistic regression on multiply imputed data, we find that for both women and men, the number of children of immigrants who identify as American decreases over time while the number who identify as racial or pan-ethnic increases. In contrast to prior studies, we find that between the ages of 14 and 24, men are more likely than women to change identities and to move away from an American identity. Women, on the other hand, tend to keep a racial or pan-ethnic identity from adolescence to adulthood. The results for within-group differences suggest that men with immigrant parents tend to reject their American identity in favor of a racial or pan-ethnic identity, a sign of adversarial outlook and marginalization. This study highlights identification patterns over time for children of immigrants, and the importance of understanding social processes separately for women and men. The implications of these results, especially the effects of discrimination, socio-economic status, and length of residence in the U.S. for identity formation, are discussed. </p>

      <p> <strong>Lee, Jennifer C. and Tamara van der Does. "Ethnic Niches and High School Employment Among Latino/as" <i> Manuscript in Progress </i> </strong> </p>
      <p> The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between parents’ own employment experiences, whether mothers and fathers are self-employed, work in an ethnic niche, or work in the mainstream economy the socioeconomic, and Hispanic- and Asian-American high school students’ work status and hours worked per week. We found that parents’ employment does influence their children’s work experiences and that this relationship varies by ethnic group. Specifically, we found that Hispanic high school students whose mothers work in an ethnic niche are less likely to be unemployed during high school. However, we found that for Asian-American students, having a mother working in a niche decreases the likelihood of working moderate hours and increases the likelihood of being unemployed. This difference in the role of parental niche employment might partly explain the higher employment rate of Hispanics during high school compared to Asian. Taken together, these findings suggest that parental niche employment can lead to participation in the labor force or retreat from work depending on one’s ethnic background. </p>

      <p> <strong> Kucinskas, Jaime and Tamara van der Does. 2017. "Gender Ideals in Turbulent Times: An Examination of Insecurity, Islam, and Muslim Men’s Gender Attitudes during the Arab Spring." <i> <a href="http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/15691330-12341428" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Published in Comparative Sociology  </a> </i> </strong> </p>
    <p>Using Arab Barometer data (2011), we examine Muslim men’s gender attitudes in four predominantly Muslim Middle Eastern and North African countries (Algeria, Egypt, Tunisia, and Yemen) during the Arab Spring. We examine if living in insecurity – which may threaten men’s ability to attain masculine ideals – is related to male overcompensation, evident in strong support for patriarchal gender ideology. They then investigate if Islamic religiosity influences this relationship. Results reveal that political Islam is strongly related to Muslim MENA men’s patriarchal gender attitudes across the region. The effects of living in insecurity and other facets of Islamic religiosity on men’s gender ideology vary by country. The results on the many effects of insecurity and Islam on men’s gender ideology challenge stereotypical representations of the region as uniformly Islamic and patriarchal. </p>

    <p> <strong> Tamara van der Does. "Muslim Americans' Voting Participation: The Role of the Mosque" <i> Under Review </i> </strong> </p>
      <p> This research examines if mosques, like other centers of worship in the United States, increase voting turnout. Previous research suggests that both religious services and other activities provide psychological and organizational resources necessary for political engagement. Using nationally representative data, this paper is the first to examine if Muslim Americans who attend mosques for core religious services and other activities are more likely to vote in presidential elections. The results suggest that attending the mosque at least once a week for core religious events increases the likelihood of voting regardless of political interest, civic engagement, and socio-economic status. Mosques in the US attract individuals with high personal religiosity and segregated networks—otherwise unlikely to vote—and encourage them to participate in mainstream politics. As with other religious organizations, mosques provide resources that link their members to the American political system. Surprisingly, participating in core religious events at mosques, but not other activities, increases voting turnout. </p>
